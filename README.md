# roblox-ai-bypass-plugin
Very OP ai bypass plugin

info for linux users: i have no idea how to install this on linux bc im a windows 11 user so figure that out yourself lmao

Steps to install:
1. Download loader.lua
2. Put loader.lua into %localappdata%\Roblox\Plugins\ directory
3. If your local plugins folder doesn't exist then just create it (it has to be case sensitive so create "Plugins" folder inside of Roblox folder)
4. Restart any studio instance if nothing showed up in plugins tab
5. Enjoy free AI bypass without having to update (it will auto update from the script on this github repo)
