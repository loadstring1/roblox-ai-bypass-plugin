# roblox-ai-bypass-plugin
Very OP ai bypass plugin

info for linux users: do the same steps as below but first find your wine/proton/etc prefix directory and then search everything else yourself (it's not that hard)

Steps to install:
1. Download [loader.lua](https://github.com/loadstring1/roblox-ai-bypass-plugin/raw/refs/heads/main/loader.lua)
2. Put [loader.lua](https://github.com/loadstring1/roblox-ai-bypass-plugin/raw/refs/heads/main/loader.lua) into %localappdata%\Roblox\Plugins\ directory
3. If your local plugins folder doesn't exist then just create it (it has to be case sensitive so create "Plugins" folder inside of Roblox folder)
4. Restart all studio instances if nothing showed up in plugins tab
5. Enjoy free AI bypass without having to update (it will auto update from the script on this github repo)
